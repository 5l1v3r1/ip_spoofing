* Use socket library in python to create sockets and send packets
* Craft a Spoofed IP packet for non-blind spoofing

* Look for ways to receive the spoofed packet (ARP-cache poisioning??)

* Build a demonstrable attack on top of it(MITM, session hijacking, DOS attack, etc)

*scapy module of python may prove to be useful for constructing IP and tcp packets -manish.


* Current Tasks

** Implement arp poision as shown in experiments/ using sockets @Akarshan
** Create a manual 'spoofed' IP packet similarly @Akshay
** Send spoofed HTTP requests and recieve the response from server@Pankaj 

* Next Tasks
** Read the replies in our spoofer
** Implement DDOS attack
** Implement MITM attack
** Implement Session Hijacking
