* Use socket library in python to create sockets and send packets
* Craft a Spoofed IP packet for non-blind spoofing

* Look for ways to receive the spoofed packet (ARP-cache poisioning??)

* Build a demonstrable attack on top of it(MITM, session hijacking, DOS attack, etc)

*scapy module of python may prove to be useful for constructing IP and tcp packets -manish.


* First Task
** Implement arp poision as shown in experiments/ using sockets @Akarshan
** Create a manual 'spoofed' IP packet similarly @Akshay
